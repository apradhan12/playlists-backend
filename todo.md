what happens to users' votes on a playlist when they become admins?
options:
- remove vote
- keep vote, but don't provide any indication


- Show playlists you manage somewhere (homepage)? we will need a route for this
- figure out what to do in case of API limits (rate limit, or max number of tracks to provide data about, etc.)
